## Final Project: Sports Match Outcome prediction Using GNNs
This is the code for the final project of this course. First a proposal for the chosen topic were written.
The code is basically a tiny subset of our (Mirzaei, Schulte, Bahrami, Mousavi) in the "Sports Match
Outcome Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Graph Representation Learning" paper. This is a minimal subset that trains a GNN from a dataset consisting only from team and player names and match outcomes using a dynamic spatio-temporal graph.
